4.1 Project Proposal

<**The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.**>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The main idea of my project will involve web pages and APIs that will be veyr valuable for me to use in my day to day life. As a finance student, financing calculators and stock analysis are a very important part of my career. I wanted to make a web page that would be able to help me with these tasks. My MVP vs. my stretch goal would be between what I am able to accomplish. These are my main ideas that I am shooting for:

-Web page to solve all finance equations you need PV, FV, PMT, NPER, RATE.
-Web Page using APIâ€™s to find the best performing stocks of a day (and the worst).
-Putting in some stock tickers and it runs a comparative analysis of the companies ratios that are inputted. 
-Put in a stock ticker and it gives back a formatted structure about its ratios, business details, and more in a formatted manner. Similar to how a Bloomberg description screen does it. 

Ideally I think it's possible to complete the top two items, the third will be a stretch (hopefully enough information is available), and the last idea would be a long shot but I'll try my best to complete it.

<**Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.**>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
My learning goals are to see how I can combine the coding knowledge that I have received while being in class and combine it with my career to see if I can transfer the skills over. I see this as the bridge point from connecting a new skill I have picked up to the career that I have been studying for. I am wokring alone so another one of my goals is to try my best to complete the project without asking for help. I know that in class I have acquired all the tools needed to complete the project, and I want to see that I can do it as well.

<**Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.**>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I have already started to look at the following API links to use, and I am planning on looking for more free links as well.

I plan on continuing to search Google to find more free links. I know that Bloomberg data is very expensive so my goal is to find a way to give similar information but for free with the API key.

<**Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses**.>**
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week of 4/9) Have all APIs that will be used. Write code for Finance Calculator Equations. Work on API for best and worst performing stocks of the day.

Week of 4/16) Finish API for best and worst performing stocks of the day. Work on Comparative Analysis Report. 

Week of 4/23) Finish Comparative Analysis Report. Work on Stock Description Page.

Week of 4/30 *short week*) Add finishing touches, and any other possible features that you think sould be added. Have web page formatting down. Turn in Assignment.

<**Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.**>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I will be working alone on this project so I will be taking on all the work. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<**Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?**>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I think the biggest threat to this problem is that not all data will be available for free. My back up plan if this is the case, is to do less but to go more indepth on the modules and functions that I have started to create.

# Final-Project

Final Project

There are many different finance possibilities through this Flask Application. From calculators to APIs, it can really help a finance professional!

<Big Idea/Goal/Why we do this>
The purpose of my project was to provide finance sudents with a one stop shop to solve problems and market analysis. There is a built in finanical calcultor which acts just like excel or a physical finance calculator to help solve TVM probelms. The Simplified Mortgage Calcultor is for new home buyers that are curious about what they should aim for in a payment given downpayment, rate, maturit etc. Or on the other hand for them to focus on an ideal rate dependent on what they want their payment, and everything else to be. There is also a link that connects to yahoo finance for those that would to see the best and worst performing stocks of the day. This was original tied to an API but was change due to monetary reasons. Then there is a simplifed Bloomberg Type company portfolio screen that when given a ticker it will provide the user with basic information about a company. Then lastly there is comparable screen that allows the user to put in two tickers and shows a comparison of compan rations that gives a simplified comparable company analysis of the two tickers.

<User Instructions>
Their is not much or the user to install besides a pip install for yfinance. All download information can be found in the link below as it is less of an API and more of a github repository. Orginally I wanted to include more API's but most information was found through yfinance wiht yahoo finance. The main path that an API was still used on was for a stock ticker but after talking with a representative at Alpha Vantage it would have gone past the minimum amount of information extracted and cost me a decent sum of money to have running.

<Implementaion Information>
The webpage is based on a button base which takes users from one page to another, the only parts that need to be explained more is the calculator and the yahoo finance webpage openings. For the web page openings the button is just tied to a function that will open a hard coded URL. For the calculator the number that is solved for is dictated by inputting a "?" when putting in the known numbers. This goes through a logic test which will in turn activate the correct function to solve.
